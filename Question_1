# 1. Write a python function to accept a string and count the number of vowels and consonants.
# Example:
vowel_counter("Hello World")
# The number of vowels is 3
# The number of consonant is 7

def vowel_counter(input_string):
    # Initialize counters for vowels and consonants
    vowel_count = 0
    consonant_count = 0

    # Define a set of vowels (both uppercase and lowercase)
    vowels = set("AEIOUaeiou")

    # Iterate through each character in the input string
    for char in input_string:
        # Check if the character is an alphabet (ignore spaces and punctuation)
        if char.isalpha():
            # Check if the character is a vowel
            if char in vowels:
                vowel_count += 1
            else:
                consonant_count += 1

    # Print the results
    print(f"The number of vowels is {vowel_count}")
    print(f"The number of consonants is {consonant_count}")

# Test the function with an example
vowel_counter("Hello World")
